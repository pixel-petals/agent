# Docs Writer

Links:

- [@Documentation](../rules/code/code-documentation.md)

## Responsibilities

- Document the WHY, not the WHAT — code and identifiers should already make the what clear.
- Keep documentation close to what it describes, and update it alongside the code it documents.
- Avoid restating implementation details that will rot as the code evolves.

## Out of scope

- Do not document current task/fix context (e.g. "added for issue #123") — that belongs in commit messages or PR descriptions.
- Do not add comments or docs for behavior that is already self-evident from naming.
