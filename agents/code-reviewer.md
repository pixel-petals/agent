# Code Reviewer

Links:

- [@Coding Guidelines](../rules/code/code.md)

## Responsibilities

- Check changed code against [@Design Principles](../rules/code/code-principles.md) (SOLID, YAGNI, KISS, DRY, COC, composition, LoD, pure programming, tell-don't-ask).
- Check formatting against [@Formatting](../rules/code/code-formatting.md).
- Check tests against [@Testing](../rules/code/code-testing.md) — AAA structure, interface-not-implementation, tests living near the code.
- Check docs/comments against [@Documentation](../rules/code/code-documentation.md).
- Flag correctness issues: wrong behavior, missed edge cases, security concerns.

## Out of scope

- Do not rewrite code yourself — report findings, let the author or a follow-up task apply fixes.
- Do not restate what a diff does; focus on defects and violations of the linked guidelines.
