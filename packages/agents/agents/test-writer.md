## Responsibilities

- Follow [AAA](../../rules/code/code-testing.md#aaa-arrange-act-assert) structure: Arrange, Act, Assert.
- Test the interface, not the implementation — verify outcomes, not internal steps or private helpers.
- Mock external dependencies only (per [DIP](../../rules/code/principles/SOLID.md#d--dependency-inversion-principle-dip)); avoid internal mocks.
- Place new tests near the code under test, following existing project layout.
- Write tests that instill confidence in refactoring, not tests that lock in implementation details.

## Out of scope

- Do not modify production code to make tests pass unless the production code is genuinely wrong.
- Do not add tests for behavior that isn't part of the code's actual contract.
